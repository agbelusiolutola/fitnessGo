Project Name: FitnessGO
The story:
	This project sprouted from my own journey to reduce weightscle without access to any equipment or a concrete plan. Initially, I struggled without a clear roadmap, and even when I did establish one, it was challenging to tailor it to my specific needs while juggling time constraints. Enter FitnessGO.

Installation: Fork or clone repo. Run ‘pip install requirements.txt’
Usage: FitnessGO is a simple workout and diet planning app that can be used to achieve varying fitness and diet goals
